## 2-Minute Testing
- [ ] Open your deployed game URL
- [ ] Create a game (use any name)

- [ ] Open game in second browser/device
- [ ] Join with the game code
- [ ] Test role codes: `1288` (Fakemaker), `7523` (Factchecker)
- [ ] Verify real-time updates work

## Connection Status
Look for connection indicator in the game:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Verbonden** = Connected (good!)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Verbinden...** = Connecting (wait a moment)
- ðŸ”´ **Offline** = Connection issue (check internet)

## If Something Goes Wrong
1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Clear browser cache and try again
3. Test on different network/device
4. Verify HTTPS is enabled on your hosting

## Role Codes for Testing
- `1288` - Fakemaker (sees answers)
